In ICS 212, we created an interactive databank that accepts, deletes, and stores data handled by the user input in C, which was later translated into C++ as another project. It was the course's pinnacle of assignments as the class taught us to learn C language, and applying that knowledge to a real-world application was both challenging and rewarding. The assignment required us to implement file handling, which meant learning how to read from and write to files efficiently.
