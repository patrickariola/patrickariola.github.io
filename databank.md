In ICS 212, I created an interactive databank database that accepts, deletes, and stores data handled by the user input in C, which was later translated into C++ as another project. It was the course's pinnacle of assignments as the class taught me to learn C language and apply that knowledge to a project like the transactions of a bank which was both challenging and rewarding. Inside the project, I created a data structure designed to represent the bank's records such as account name, number, and address by added order. These data were ensured to be stored correctly and in order.

Prior to the implementation of data, the program featured an interactive command-line interface that allowed users to add, delete, and view records. The user interface included the commands: add, printall, find, delete, and quit. Each command was accessible by just entering the first to any proceeding letter of the word. So if the user wanted to view all the records through 'printall', typing just 'pri' would be sufficient. The program considered and handled invalid user inputs and requested the user to enter a valid input.

The project also implemented file handling, which meant learning how to read from and write to files efficiently. To make sure these were running smoothly, debugging was done to keep track of the data's channeling throughout the program.

Overall, this project was a significant milestone in my coding journey.
