## The Impact of Coding Standards 

Coding standards go beyond simple formatting details, they shape how code is structured, making it more readable, maintainable, and consistent. to coding itself. Sticking to these standards help to internalize these practices of a programming language ultimately creating more cleaner and efficient code. After a week of using ESLint with VSCode. I’ve come to realize that it can get annoying at times. This is especially true when I’m deeply focused on implementing features or solving specific problems, only to have the linter constantly interrupt me with notifications about errors or style issues. This disruption can break my concentration and slow down my workflow. Additionally, getting used to VSCode, navigating its interface, setting up projects, preparing files, and learning various commands adds another layer of difficulty to my coding experience. It requires a shift in my mindset as I get used to this new environment, which can be overwhelming.

However, I also recognize that this feedback is necessary for improving my coding practices. It encourages me to think about my code structure and consistency. My previous ICS212 class had coding standards as a grading component and while it felt tedious at times, it significantly helped improve the readability of the code I produced, especially since it was my first exposure to learning C/C++. Many of the coding standards emphasized by my professor such as clear naming conventions, proper indentation, and organized function declarations are actually quite similar to the rules enforced by ESLint. I understand why the professor and TA emphasized coding standards a lot. It makes it easier for them to read as well and absorb the contents of the code, which is essential when providing feedback or collaborating with others. When everyone adheres to the same standards, it creates this environment where ideas can be shared more easily, and issues can be identified more quickly.

This experience has solidified the idea that coding standards are not just about aesthetics of spaces to indent, curly brace placements, and such; they serve a practical purpose that improves both individual and collective productivity. Overall, I see the value in coding standards, and I appreciate how they contribute to both my growth as a programmer and the overall quality of the code I produce.
