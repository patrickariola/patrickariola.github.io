## The Impact of Coding Standards 

Coding standards go beyond simple formatting details, they shape how code is structured, making it more readable, maintainable, and consistent. to coding itself. Sticking to these standards help to internalize these practices of a programming language thus creating more cleaner and efficient code.

After a week of using ESLint with VSCode, I believe it can get annoying at times, especially when I'm focused on implementing features and the linter keeps pointing out errors or style issues. With also getting used to VSCode and the file preparations and learning the commands adds another layer to consider.

However, I also recognize that this feedback is crucial for improving my coding practices. It encourages me to think about my code structure and consistency. My previous ICS212 class had coding standards as a grading component and while it was tedious, it did help with the readability of the code since it was also my first time learning C/C++. Many of the standards that the professor used are actually similar with ESLint. I understand why the professor and TA emphasized coding standards a lot. It makes it easier for them to read as well and absorb the contents of the code, which is essential when providing feedback or collaborating with others.

This experience has solidified the idea that coding standards are not just about aesthetics of spaces to indent, curly brace placements, and such; they serve a practical purpose. Overall, I see the value in coding standards, and I appreciate how they contribute to both my growth as a programmer and the overall quality of the code I produce.
