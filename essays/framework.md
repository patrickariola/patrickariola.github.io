## UI Shenanigans

Being new to UI frameworks, I don't have much input to offer when it comes to practical experiences or specific project applications. However, I understand that using a framework like Bootstrap 5 provides a solid foundation for creating simple webpages and designs that can be easily integrated into much larger projects. Getting started with HTML and CSS gave me a rough idea of how to structure content and apply basic styles, and a lot of it is similar to Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 uses familiar syntax so that transition between the two was convenient. Just like other learning other languages, it requires learning the syntax and conventions, but the core principles remain consistent. There a lot of built-in tools that achieve common function like centering the text, making columns and rows, etc. It can get pretty overwhelming trying to distinguish these and overall which would work better. 

The WODs can get very confusing in this section. While the concepts are the same and arguably align with the course's semester progression, some of the WODs present these concepts at a higher level. It can be challenging and demotivating at times when I get a DNF. For example, the Island Snow WOD came at full force as a three-sectioned assignment introducing navigation bars, colored blocks, and footers. The subsequent WODs are much the same or less similar, some introducing a new or different complexity, or a twist on the content. I especially liked the WOD on Murphy's Bar and Grill. I thought it was good and encompassed everything that was covered so far. Things like:<br>
<code>    <ul class="nav justify-content-end" id="topMenu">
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#">About Us</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#">St. Patrick's Day</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#">To Go Ordering</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#"><i class="bi bi-instagram p-1"></i></a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#"><i class="bi bi-facebook p-1"></i></a></li>
        <li class="nav-item" style="margin-right: 20px;"><a class="nav-link" href="#"><i class="bi bi-twitter p-1"></i></a></li>
            </ul></code><br>
<br>are such a hassle sometimes especially when you have to gather the necessary classes and styles to make sure that everything aligns properly. It's definitely a challenge.

As of right now, I believe Bootstrap 5 is an okay framework. I don't hold much experience for any other framework aside from HTML and CSS. It does what it needs to do and for now I think that's enough. The next steps would be exploring UI Design in React which implements all the functions and interactive features a website would need.
