Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and my senior year of high school, I created my Health Capstone projet targeting what was becoming a very relatable and sensitive topic at the time of lockdown: Mental Health. I found myself struggling with this subject and wanted to take the form of my project in a way that could both express my own experiences and offer support to others facing similar challenges. My goal was to raise awareness, provide resources, and open a way to converse about mental health reducing its stigma all while offering support during a particularly difficult period.

Here is how the plan was formatted: 20 participants (ages 15-18) committed to 21-day Wellness Plan (Oct 12. to Nov. 1) featuring three apps to visit daily, all conveniently accessible, with a pre and post-survey to evaluate its impact.
