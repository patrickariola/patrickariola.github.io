Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and my senior year of high school, I created my Health Capstone projet targeting what was becoming a very relatable and sensitive topic at the time of lockdown: Mental Health. I found myself struggling with this subject and wanted to take the form of my project in a way that could both express my own experiences and offer support to others facing similar challenges. My goal was to raise awareness, provide resources, and open a way to converse about mental health reducing its stigma all while offering support during a particularly difficult period.

Here is how the plan was formatted: 20 participants (ages 15-18) committed to 21-day Wellness Plan (Oct 12. to Nov. 1) featuring three apps to visit daily, all conveniently accessible, with a pre and post-survey to evaluate its impact.

The project was overseen by an advisor from school and outside school, a community mentor whom I reached out to Anisa Wiseman, the program director of NAMI Hawaii. My mentor directed me to bring about a more effective and impactful approach, offering her insights on mental health. Towards the end of the project, I was interviewed by three official judges who would evaluate my work. I received very high marks and positive feedback, which affirmed me the project's success and the connection I felt with it. It was a very endearing and memorable experience, as it had resonated with me intensely at the time.
